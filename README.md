Notice 1: We are excited to announce that our current tool has been ported to a PowerShell version. This means that users can now access and use the tool directly from the PowerShell command line, making it even more convenient and efficient to use. We believe that this new version will greatly benefit our users and enhance their experience with the tool. Thank you for your continued support and we hope you enjoy the new PowerShell version: https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/power-brute-logon

Notice 2: We have recently learned that Microsoft has enabled the account lockdown policy by default in modern and up-to-date versions of Windows. This policy helps to secure the system by locking an account after a certain number of failed login attempts. While this is a beneficial security measure, it  renders the proof-of-concept (PoC) inefficient on these systems.

# Win Brute Logon (Proof Of Concept)

Release date: `2020-05-14`

Target: Windows XP to Latest Windows 10 Version (1909)

![Console](https://i.ibb.co/Cm5052S/screen.png)

Weakness location : `LogonUserA`, `LogonUserW`, `CreateProcessWithLogonA`, `CreateProcessWithLogonW`

## Usage

### Wordlist File

`WinBruteLogon.exe -u <username> -w <wordlist_file>`

### Stdin Wordlist

`type <wordlist_file> | WinBruteLogon.exe -u <username> -`

# Introduction

Win Brute Logon is designed to simulate a brute-force attack on a Microsoft account by guessing large numbers of password combinations in a short amount of time. This allows pentesters to test the security posture of their systems and assess their defenses against brute-force attacks. The tool exploits the lack of an account lockout mechanism, which is a common weakness in many systems (before account lockout becomes enabled by default on Windows 11). By attempting to guess the password of an account, the tool can help pentesters identify and address vulnerabilities in their security measures. It should be used responsibly and within the bounds of the law.

# PoC Test Scenario (With a Guest Account)

For this demonstration, we will set up a fresh version of Windows 10 on a virtual or physical machine. Once the machine is set up, log in as an administrator. Next, create two different local accounts: one administrator account and one regular user account. Please note that although we will be using the guest account for the demo, this proof-of-concept (PoC) is not limited to the guest account. It can be used from any account or group, including guest, regular user, and admin user.

## Create a new admin user

`net user darkcodersc /add`

`net user darkcodersc trousers` (trousers is the password)

`net localgroup administrators darkcodersc /add`

## Create a regular user

`net user HackMe /add`

`net user HackMe ozlq6qwm` (ozlq6qwm is the password)

## Create a new Guest account

`net user GuestUser /add`

`net localgroup users GuestUser /delete`

`net localgroup guests GuestUser /add`

## Get a Wordlist 

In my case both `trousers` and `ozlq6qwm` are in SecList : https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt

## Start the attack

To begin the demonstration, log off from the administrator account or restart the machine and log in to the guest account. Then, place the PoC executable in a location where you have access as a guest user.

Usage : `WinBruteLogon.exe -v -u <username> -w <wordlist_file>`

`-v` is optional, it design the verbose mode.

By default, domain name is the value designated by `%USERDOMAIN%` env var. You can specify a custom name with option `-d`

### Crack First User : `darkcodersc` (Administrator)

prompt(guest)>`WinBruteLogon.exe -v -u darkcodersc -w 10k-most-common.txt`

Wait few seconds to see the following result:

````

### Crack Second User : `HackMe` (Regular User)

Wait few seconds to see the following result:

# Real world scenario

"In a real-world scenario, if an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user account, they may be able to crack the password of a more privileged user and escalate their privileges. To mitigate this risk, there are a few steps that can be taken:

* If present, disable any guest accounts.
* Implement application white-listing to restrict the execution of unauthorized software.
* Follow guidelines for creating and maintaining strong passwords for all users.

To implement a security lockout policy (which is not enabled by default), follow these steps:

* Open the 'secpol.msc' utility.
* Navigate to 'Account Policies' > 'Account Lockout Policy'
* Edit the 'Account lockout threshold' value with a desired number of attempts (from 1 to 999). This value represents the number of failed login attempts before the account is locked.

Please note that the lockout policy does not apply to the administrator account. In this case, the best protection for the administrator account (if enabled) is to set up a very complex password.

A report detailing this weakness has been sent to the Microsoft Security Team. They should consider enabling the account lockout policy by default."

(UPDATE 2022) : Account lockout **finally** enabled by default.
